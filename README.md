**About**:

This program makes use of PCA to recognize a face from a database. The principal components are projected onto the eigenspace to find the eigenfaces and an unknown face is recognized using minimum euclidean distance of projection onto all the face classes on the eigenspace.

**Database**:

The test and training database is taken from here: http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/17032-pca-based-face-recognition-system.
